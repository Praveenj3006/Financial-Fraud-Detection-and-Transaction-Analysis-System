# Financial-Fraud-Detection-and-Transaction-Analysis-System
To detect fraudulent financial transactions in real-time using machine learning algorithms. 

# Project Overview:
The Financial Fraud Detection and Transaction Analysis System is designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions in real-time using machine learning algorithms. The system processes financial transaction data, builds predictive models to classify fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions, and provides real-time alerts through SMS, email, or other notification systems to prevent fraudulent activities.

The system integrates advanced data engineering, machine learning, and real-time processing techniques to create an efficient, scalable fraud detection solution for financial institutions.

# Key Components:
Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:

The system ingests financial transaction data, cleans, and preprocesses it by scaling features like transaction amount and time. It also handles missing values and outliers for better model performance.
Machine Learning Model:

The core of the system is a Random Forest model trained on labeled financial transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions.
Class imbalance is addressed using SMOTE to oversample the minority (fraudulent) class, improving the model's ability to detect rare fraudulent transactions.
The model is evaluated on test data using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Real-Time Detection:

The system is capable of real-time detection by processing incoming transactions through the trained machine learning model. It continuously monitors transactions for potential fraud.
Alert Mechanism:

SMS Alerts: Integration with Twilio to send SMS notifications when fraudulent transactions are detected.
Email Alerts: Using SMTP (e.g., Gmail) to send email alerts when fraud is detected.
The system can be easily extended to use other notification services like AWS SNS or Webhook notifications.
Data Visualization:

Optional integration with Tableau or Power BI to provide a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring transactions, fraud trends, and model performance over time.
Tools and Technologies:
Data Processing: Pandas, Numpy
Modeling: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), SMOTE (for handling class imbalance)
Real-Time Alerts: Twilio (SMS), SMTP (Email), AWS SNS (optional)
Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI (optional)
Deployment: Flask, FastAPI, or other web frameworks (optional for serving the model)
# Outcome:
The Financial Fraud Detection System successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall, reducing false negatives, and improving overall fraud detection rates. The systemâ€™s ability to send real-time alerts ensures that fraudulent activity is addressed immediately, protecting financial assets and preventing losses.

This project showcases proficiency in data engineering, machine learning, and real-time alerting systems, making it a valuable asset for financial organizations aiming to minimize the risk of fraud.
